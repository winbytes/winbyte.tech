Hello, hope everyone reading this is doing well! I am updating my username to "winbyte" or "xwinbyte" on most platforms.

I am doing so as I wish to separate my name as an individual from my username on the internet. This is mainly for personal reasons I would prefer not to delve into.

Over the coming days, most platforms will reflect the name change. I have updated the links on this page, and will continue to do so as I get to them.

This new name has been the name of my YouTube channel for quite a while. It acts as a successor to the "WindowsWorld" identity, and while 
I considered using this name again, it refers more to a community, rather than a person (even if I did use the name as my username for quite a while).
Plus, the name was copied from another individual anyways, and I would prefer to at least use a name I came up with. 

You can still refer to me as Cori, as that is still the name I wish to go by. The username change is purely for said personal reasons. 

Thanks for your understanding,

coriwaaaaaa :3
