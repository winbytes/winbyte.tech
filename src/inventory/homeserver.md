____________________________________________________________________________________________
This server comes in handy for accessing my data within and outside of my network. It was just set up a month or so ago as of writing this, and I hope to
find even more uses for it as time passes! It is powerful enough to host a game server for friends, run VMs as a hypervisor, or simply run Docker containers.
It was quite a task to manage to fit all of these drives inside this mini tower case..
