Got this phone for pretty cheap, although I had to replace the screen. I wasn't smart when I bought it and didn't check to see whether or not the parts were aftermarket in it. Turns out the camera (genuine but replaced), display, and battery were all aftermarket. The camera works okay, definitely has OIS issues though and the rear mic sounds weird. The screen was terrible. An Aliexpress soft OLED for sure. I replaced it with a genuine reglassed display and now the phone is practically perfect aside from previously mentioned camera issues. I'll probably hold onto this for a while and then upgrade to the 16 Pro or base 17 when either reaches a reasonable price. 

Hardware Configuration:

<ul>
<li>SoC: A15 Bionic
<li>Capacity: 256GB
<li>Color: Sierra Blue
<li>Display: 2532x1170 120Hz OLED
<li>Battery: 11.97Wh (3,095 mAh)
<li>Camera (rear): 12MP Wide, Telephoto, Ultra Wide
<li>Camera (front): 12MP
<li>Case: Unbranded cheap Amazon clear case
</ul>

Love this phone, first 120Hz iPhone I have used and it's great. Battery life is average, way lower than my OnePlus 12R but that's to be expected. Love the size, I never want a phone bigger than this!
